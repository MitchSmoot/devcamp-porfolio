# Mitch's Portfolio/Blog Website

This is my website. As of now, its pimary purpose is to show off my web developing skills to potential employers.

I have a blog on here as well, where I'll be writing about random topics that seem cool to me.

I'll be continually updating this for the forseeable future.
